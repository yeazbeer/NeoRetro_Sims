## 1. Project Overview
NeoRetro Sims is a demo online shop showcasing retro pixel-themed collectibles: action figures, anime figures, game figures, pixel keychains, retro consoles, posters, desk decor, and stationery. The site implements a classic 90s retro style with a dark theme, pixel-inspired typography, and neon accents.

## 2. Technologies used
- HTML5 for page structure
- CSS3 for styling (single stylesheet: style.css)
- JavaScript (vanilla) for light interactivity (modal product view, category filters, search, client-side "contact" form)
- Images stored in `/images/` folder

## 3. Pages
- `index.html` — Homepage with hero, featured items, categories.
- `shop.html` — Shop listing, search and sort, product cards.
- `about.html` — Project description and goals.

## 5. How to run (local)
1. Make sure all files are saved in a single folder (NeoRetroSims_Full/).
2. Place images in the images/ subfolder (they are included).
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), or run a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.
4. The site is fully client-side — no server required.
